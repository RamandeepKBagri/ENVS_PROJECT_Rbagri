# Wildfire Project: Preliminary data (Calfire) exploration
## This project is done during ENVS 265 (UCSC) clas, plus for the research proposal while working on Calfire data for the grid resilience project with Prof Yihsu Chen, ECE, UCSC. 
### Future Expectation: Improving the writing code ability while displaying all the comments next to the code.
### This is first version, I will say raw files of the project.
#### Note: These are unpublished results and submitted for the research proposal, which needed more time to polish the work done. As I am MS student, this was my last quarter and I followed my graduation plans and learning some more interesting subjects. Therefore, this code is open for the community to use, if needed and cite the work. 


##### Citation: R code is taken from Data camp resources. Debuging is done using stackoverflow website, R community.
##### Thank you!
