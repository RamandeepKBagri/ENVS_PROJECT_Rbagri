# WILDFIRE MODELING: DESIGNING A MARKET TO RESTORE ASSETS
## Abstract 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ```In the past decade, summer wildfires have become the norm in California (CA), United States of America (USA). These wildfires are caused due to variety of reasons. The state collects wildfire funds to help the impacted customers. However, the funds are el- igible only under certain conditions and are collected uniformly throughout California. Therefore, the overall idea of this project is to look for quantitative results on how elec- trical corporations cause wildfires and how they can help to collect the wildfire funds or charge fairly to the customers to maximize the social impact.``` \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ```The research project aims to propose the implication of wildfire risk associated with vegetation, and due to power lines and incorporate that in dollars. Therefore, the project helps to solves the problem of collecting wildfire funds associated to each location and incorporate with energy prices to charge their customers according to their wildfire risk related to the location to maximize the social surplus for the society.``` \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ```The first section of the thesis shows the wildfire analysis and determines the risk based on each location (project focus is at California and it’s counties). The proposal will use the previous year’s data to forecast the wildfire risk as the next step to solve the wildfire modeling. Electrical corporations are also taking actions to prevent the wildfires from their system using Public Safety and Power Shutoffs (PSPS) events. The primary purpose of the PSPS event is to de-energize the selected circuits depending on weather data. We are focusing on the PSPS events data to see if the frequency of PSPS events targets the low-income areas in order to avoid customer exploitation due to unrevealed characterization of the location. Therefore, we are using a data-driven approach to maximize the social surplus for the customers and reveal the impact of PSPS strategy on the customers.``` \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ```The second part of the thesis determines the variable wildfire risk associated with each location using an energy pricing strategy that is the location marginal price method. These findings suggest that designing wildfire risk premium using a Risk-based Eco- nomic Dispatch and Location based marginal pricing method gives electrical corpo- rations information to operate the developed methodology. The goal is to collect the wildfire funds based on the customers living at high-risk areas or living at low-risk ar- eas instead of charging all customers almost around $6 uniformly from all customers throughout CA every month.``` \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ```The thesis findings will help to calculate the risk premium involving wildfire risk associated with the location and incorporate the risk into pricing. The research of this submitted proposal provides the potential contribution towards detecting the utilities associated wildfire risk in the power lines, which can prevent wildfires by controlling the line flows of the system. Ultimately, this proposal’s goal is a social benefit to save money for the electrical corporations and their customers in California, who pay ”Wildfire Fund charges” each month $5.85/KWH. Therefore, this proposal will propose meth- ods to collect wildfire funds with maximum customer surplus for future generations.``` \

###### Note: 
``` This is first version, I will say raw files of the project. These are unpublished results and submitted for the research proposal, which needed more time to polish the work done. As I am MS student, this was my last quarter and I followed my graduation plans and learning some more interesting subjects. Therefore, this code is open for the community to use, if needed and cite the work.
