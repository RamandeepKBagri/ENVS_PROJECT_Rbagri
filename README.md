# Wildfire Project: Preliminary data (Calfire) exploration
## This project is done for ENVS 265 (UCSC) plus for the research proposal while working on Calfire data for the grid resilience project with Prof Yihsu Chen, ECE, UCSC. 
### Future Expectation: Improving the writing code ability while displaying all the comments next to the code.
### This is first version, I will say raw files of the project.
