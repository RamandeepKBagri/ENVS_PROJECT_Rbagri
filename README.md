# Wildfire Project: Preliminary data (Calfire) exploration
## This project is done for ENVS 265 (UCSC) plus for the research proposal while working on Calfire data for the grid resilience project with Prof Yihsu Chen, ECE, UCSC. 
### Future Expectation: Improving the writing code ability while displaying all the comments next to the code.
### This is first version, I will say raw files of the project.
#### Note: These are unpublished results and submitted for the research proposal, which didn't meet the requirements. Therefore, this code is open for the community to use, if needed and cite the work.
